What is this?

A template extension for OPA's Template.default engine.


What is this good for?

To create a meta language that simplifies Twitters bootstrap toolkit even a bit
more. Although it is already quite simple, the readability and usability could
still be improved further.


How can this be used (finally)?

Examples:
  
without oxml                            with oxml

<body>                                | <body>
  <div class="container-fluid">       |   <container layout="fluid">
    <div class="sidebar">             |     <sidebar>
      ...                             |       ...
    </div>                            |     </sidebar>
    <div class="content">             |     <content>
      ...                             |       ...
    </div>                            |     </content>
  </div>                              |   </container>
</body>                               | </body>

<div class="row">                     | <row>
  <div class="span4">                 |   <col span="4">
    ...                               |     ...
  </div>                              |   </col>
  <div class="span10 offset2">        |   <col span="10" offset="2">
    ...                               |     ...
  </div>                              |   </col>
</div>                                | </row>

<div class="alert-message warning">   | <alert strength="warning">
  <a class="close" href="#">×</a>     |   <strong>Holy guacamole!</strong>
  <p><strong>Holy guacamole!</strong> |   Best check yo self, you’re not 
    Best check yo self, you’re not    |   looking too good.
    looking too good.</p>             | </alert>
</div>                                |

...                                   | ...


How can I use it?

Import the oxml module and render the page content via Oxml.create(). The
content can either be included from a template file or just as a string. See
main.opa how it is done.


What is still to do?

Completing it. ;)

Currently this can just be used via a specified namespace, so every customized
tag has to be like "<o:...>". Is there any way to omit the namespace usage?

There might be some problems with tags already used, like <label>. How can this
be differenced? Same problem might occur with "reserved" attribute names like
class etc.

How can Javascript functionality be implemented? F.e. table sorter, modals,
popovers, etc.

Less?
